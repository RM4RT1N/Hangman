# Hangman
#
The application was written as an exercise in a group of 3 during the course. 

It is a digital version of the Hangman game.

The aim of the project was to write a console version of the game using the Python language.

The project is written using external file support to load a list of words and draw words through the game.  The player receives a graphical representation of the game state with animation elements, which has only been achieved in the console.

In the future, the project can be extended to include other categories of guessed words and the creation of a history of best results.  

The game is a back-end application.
